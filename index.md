I previously earned a Bachelor's degree in Financial Mathematics at Shandong University, and spent three years as a private math/economics instructor in Zhejiang. I am also interested in language, endurance training, teaching, and non-fiction literary reportage / volunteer fieldwork. Here is my [[CV]](assets/CV_MingZhang_en)
